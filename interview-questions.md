# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: It has been my experience that functions are like Legos And without them doing their job you would never be able to build a Lego sculpture. What I mean by that is it takes functions to build up your porject. Functions are useful in not only JavaScript but all different programming languages, Because they are used as building blocks in any project you want to accomplish. 

  Researched answer: According to the syllabus "functions are a fundamental building block in JavaScript and in programming in general. Functions are reusable pieces of code that only execute when invoked and always return an output." By reading that it lets me know that I was on the right track with my answer. 



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: A parameter is an external source of information why the arguments process that parameter for a outcome For instants if I was designing a function for a Thermometer that told you if the temperature was above or below the boiling point. I would first create a parameter called boiling point then create the Arguments that if the temperature was below 212Â° it would display and tell you so if it was higher and it will tell you that if you were right on the money it would tell you that you were at the boiling point.

  Researched answer: Doing the research I found that I'm on the right track but the way that my answer explains it the function wouldn't be called boiling point it would be called temp where you could put in the temperatures so that the code would run in order to know if your above, below or right on the money.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a way to identify elements and what place they hold.So therefore the difference between a value and an index is that the index is a placeholder starting at zero and counting up and a value is the actual value of what you've put in, like data type number, string And so forth.

  Researched answer: According to my research of value is part of an array. The array can hold as many values Do you want and there are certain commands that you can use to change the values in an array. Now an index is a way to find out how many values there are in that array and what number order they're in there is such a thing called zero indexing.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: These are methods that are built into the program to help us code quicker and easier. They are tools for developers to use such as a mechanic uses a wrench we use built-in methods. Could you imagine if we didn't have them we would have to re-create the same methods over and over and over again. It's like asking a mechanic to do anything without using a wrench. It's not that it's impossible it would just take a lot longer to accomplish whatever you were trying to do.

  Researched answer: There are many built in methods in arrays, Because arrays sotre alot of date And the built-in methods make it easy for us to manipulate that data. We used a lot of them in our Assessments this week. A built-in method is a small piece of code that has been added to accomplish a common task. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: There is always a driver and a navigator. It is the drivers job to be the one to code and it is the navigators job to help guide and direct the driver. This does not mean that the navigator forces the driver to go his direction all the time. It means that the navigator allows for clear and concise communication between the two of them so that they can accomplish the goals. In class when we did the challenges me and my Partner would designate how many challenges they were going to do versus how many challenges I was going to do. It is very important for you to switch places and get comfortable being in both roles.

  Researched answer: In my research I found out that I nailed it right on the head. Pair programming is a great technique for developers to collaborate on projects. It allows for the saying two heads are better than one to be true. When I first heard the term pair programming I thought it was going to suck. I like working by myself and asking questions when I need help. It's very nerve-racking to me to have somebody always looking over my shoulder. But the more we have done this I have realized that it makes it easier to ask questions because I already have a partner looking over my shoulder.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: The assessment I really found it to be not only challenging but it reinforced all that we had learned over the week. When I heard that you guys were giving us assessment and then saw how big it was I thought great there goes my whole weekend but it didn't take up that much time. I broke it up into sections got that section done took a break and then came back to it. It's going to be really interesting when we're all done and I can look back and read this and see the difference between my coding now versus four months from now. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: This is a term used to describe how many times something is done. 

2. Higher Order Functions: This is a term used to describe a function that uses other functions in its argument

3. Jest: This is a program that runs through your JavaScript to make sure that you have clean code

4. Classes: These have to do with objects and giving them the blueprints of how to work and they have their own scope

5. React: React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces
