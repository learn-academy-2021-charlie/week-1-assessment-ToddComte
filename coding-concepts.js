// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding conceptual questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

var cohort = "Charlie 2021"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: 11
// when I see .length I assume that it is going to count how many thing they are with in the double quotations. 
// I also though of the index and counted all of the of the individual inputs.

// b) Verify and explain: 12 
// We I ran the code two thoughts came to mind.
// One, How did I get an ID-10T error.
// Two, Great Todd you got in a rush and didn't see the big picture. 
// when I see a probelm that I know the answer to I just run with it. 
// If I had Just slow down and thought though it, I would have remembered the space counts as an input. 

// --------------------2) What will this log?

var greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[3])

// a) Your answer: l
// because of the sqare bracket grouped with greeting.
// this is a clear indication that it will diplay the thrid letter in the string.

// b) Verify and explain: l
// Accding to the syllabus this code is accessing an elament. 
// It makes my feel like I'm on the right track.

// --------------------3) What will this log?

var languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
var index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: Ruby
// When I saw the word index I look at the array and put the numbers over it starting with 0, 1, 2, 3,
// When my brother frist started teaching me he made sure to poud it in my head.
 
// b) Verify and explain: Ruby
// No surprise here, I would like to take this time to thank my brother, you and Sara.
// It's people like you guys that have lead me down this raod that made this question easy 


// --------------------4) What will this log?

var weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: SATURDAY, SUNDAY
// when I saw this code I knew right away what it was going to do because of coding with my brother.
// I knew that .toUpperCase would change all of the letters in the string to being upper case.
//If you look in the syllabus under Stream methods and properties you will find a perfect example of what this code is supposed to do.

// b) Verify and explain: It said that weekendDays.toUpperCase is not a function
// As I said earlier I was pretty confident that it would give me SATURDAY and SUNDAY ALL capitalized.
// The reason this is not a function is because it's an array because of the square brackets around it.
// When you read the syllabus it will tell you that it is supposed to capitalize all the elements in the string the key being 


// --------------------5) What will this log?

var dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: number
// When I saw this code 2 things came to my mind one Was that it was counting the Length of all the strings
// The thing that made me question and doubt myself was typeof which I know displays if it is a number string or boolean
// I guess I'll run the code and see if I'm right I'm not entirely sure of my way of thinking.

// b) Verify and explain: number
// OK looks like the number was the correct answer.
// The reason that number is the right answer is because  .length Converts it into a number of how many characters are in the array.
// Then typeof gives you the name of the datatype, Not to be confused with the variable datatypes
